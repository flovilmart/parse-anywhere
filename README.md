parse-anywhere
=========

formerly [parse-develop](https://github.com/flovilmart/parse-develop)

Run your parse powered webapps anywhere

## What does it do

It create and managed a wrapped environment in node.js in order to emulate the cloud/ dependencies. You can now run all your parse code on any server.

It leverages [forever-monitor](https://npmjs.com/packages/forever-monitor) to spawn a child process and have a clean environment there.


## Installation

#### To run on a cloud service


	npm install --save parse-anywhere
	
in your `package.json` replace the npm start script:

```
{
	...
	"scripts": {
		"start": "parse-anywhere"
	}
	...
}
```



#### With npm
	
	npm install parse-anywhere -g

#### From source:

clone the repo in your favorite place:

	git clone git://github.com/flovilmart/parse-anywhere.git
	cd parse-anywhere
	npm install -g
	
That will install the local parse environment wrapper in the parse-develop directory

##Prepare your configuration:

Two options are possible in order to run it. 

### Option 1


```
export PARSE_APPLICATION_ID=""
export PARSE_JAVASCRIPT_KEY=""
export PARSE_MASTER_KEY=""
```

With those 3 keys set, `parse-anywhere` will be able to run your project.

Note that if all keys are found in the environment, the process will stop and we'll use those.


### Option 2

You can set your keys in the `.parse.local` file or the `config/global.json`

Locate your configuration file and set the javascriptKey:

```
	{
		"my_parse_app": {
			"applicationId": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
      		"javascriptKey": REPLACE_ME,
      		"masterKey": "XXXXXXX","
		}
	}
```


### Limitations:

As of today, the cloud functions are not enabled yet, but that's in the plan since Parse just opened it in the form of webhooks. Sit tight, it's gonna be there soon.


## How to use

### From command line:

- From your parse app directory: 

	`parse-anywhere`

- If you have multiple apps in your config.json: 

	`parse-anywhere my_parse_app`

- From any directory:

	`parse-anywhere path/to/directory`
	

## Custom Configuration


Overriding the default configuration is at your own risks and may render your installation unstable, please use with care!

Environment:

	export PORT=8080 // set the port for the http server

It is possible to change the behavior of forever monitor through a rc file (we use the rc module).

To further configure, create a `.parse-anywhererc` or  file in your root project directory (replace my_app by the name of your app) 

Note: if you override the port in the RC configuration, the environment variable will be ignored.

From there, you can configure pretty much everything in forever monitor 

Visit [RC Standards](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards) for more informations

All parameters of forever-monitor are available for configuration but some are automatically overriden (otherwise the whole app doesn't work)

The parameters from forever-monitor that can't be changed are:

`options, env, sourceDir, watchDirectory`

Even if `watchDirectory` can't be overriden, you can disable `watch` by setting `watch=false`

If you set `debug=1`, that will override the command parameter to `node --debug`, it has the same effect as `command="node --debug"`

The default options for are:

	{
		// Forever monitor options
    	command: "node",
    	spawnWith: {
      		setsid: false
    	},
    	watch:true,
    	minUptime: 1000,
    	spinSleepTime: 500,
    	
    	// expressjs port
    	port: 8080 || process.env.PORT
  	}
